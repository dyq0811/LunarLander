# LunarLander

This program creates a simulation of a vehicle landing on the moon. (It turns out that this is also a rather old computer game that has been around for decades.)


Here is how it works: You are in control of a lunar lander ship, descending to the surface of the moon for a landing. Gravity steadily accelerates your ship faster and faster toward the surface of the moon. You, the astronaut piloting the ship, have a single control: a button with the label "thrust" on it. Applying thrust slows your ship down. Your goal is to get your ship to land on the moon at a slow enough speed so that it doesn't crash on impact. What's the catch? You have only a limited amount of fuel. If you slow down your ship too much too early, you will run out of fuel and crash into the surface of the moon.


There is an alternative simulation class called SimulationRace that is very similar to Simulation but has two LunarLander objects descending to the moon, each controlled by different users. The two players alternate back and forth entering thrust for their own landers, until one of them lands or until they both crash. Have fun with it :)
